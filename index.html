        Raccoon is looking for all his friends in the forest. But they are
        hiding! It’s your job to help him find them.

      <ul>
        <li>1. Flip over two cards each turn.</li>
        <li>
          2. If both cards show the same animal, great! You score a point.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. If they are different animals, they will turn back face down again.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. Be quick! There’s a timer that keeps getting faster as you go
          through the level.
        </li>
        <li>5. Find all the pairs before time runs out to win the game!</li>
